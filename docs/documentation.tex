Pharmacy Duty Roster (PDR) is a web application that allows to operate a duty roster for pharmacies.
PDR started in 2015 as an alternative to a really simple excel sheet without formulas.
PDR aims to be user-friendly but at the same time cover all necessary features.
PDR continuously strives to improve. It is open to your requests and wishes.
I hope it will fulfill your expectations.
