\chapter{Introduction}
Pharmacy Duty Roster (PDR) is a web application that allows to operate a duty roster for pharmacies.
PDR started in 2015 as an alternative to a really simple excel sheet without formulas.
PDR aims to be user-friendly but at the same time cover all necessary features.
PDR continuously strives to improve. It is open to your requests and wishes.
I hope it will fulfill your expectations.

There are four views to the absence data.
\begin{itemize}
\item Employee view readonly

\item Year overview
\end{itemize}
In the \emph{Employee view readonly} there is a select element to choose the employee to view. There is a button to switch to the edit view.
And there is a table containing the absence data. The columns are start and end of the absence, reason of absence and number of days.
There is a distinct list of possible reasons ( vacation,
        remaining holiday,
       sickness,
        sickness of child,
        unpaid leave of absence,
        paid leave of absence,
        parental leave and

The number of days of absence is calculated for a 5 day week. Absences on saturdays and sundays are registered but not counted. The same applys for holidays.
