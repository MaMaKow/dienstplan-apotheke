\subsubsection{Roster week table view}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{{images/en_GB/roster-week-table.php}.png}
	\caption{Roster week table view, excerpt without task rotation and weekly working hours}
	\label{img_roster_week_table_view}
\end{figure}

The roster week table view shows the roster of a chosen week an a chosen branch (Figure \ref{img_roster_week_table_view}). If employees of the branch are working in an other branch, then those are shown below.
The table foot contains the information about absent employees and their reason of absence.

The date can be chosen by direct input. It can also be shifted by one week backwards or forwards by pressing \keys{\ctrl + \shift + $\rightarrow$} or \keys{\ctrl + \shift + $\leftarrow$} respectively.

\subsubsection{Roster daily view}
\subsubsection{Roster employee view}
\subsubsection{Overtime}
\subsubsection{Absence}
There are four views to the absence data.
\begin{itemize}
\item Employee view readonly
\item Employee view edit
\item Monthly table
\item Year overview
\end{itemize}
In the \emph{Employee view readonly} there is a select element to choose the employee to view. There is a button to switch to the edit view.
And there is a table containing the absence data. The columns are start and end of the absence, reason of absence and number of days.
There is a distinct list of possible reasons ( vacation,
        remaining holiday,
       sickness,
        sickness of child,
        unpaid leave of absence,
        paid leave of absence,
        parental leave and
        maternity leave).
The number of days of absence is calculated for a 5 day week. Absences on saturdays and sundays are registered but not counted. The same applys for holidays.
