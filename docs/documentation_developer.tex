\section{Core development}
All PHP scripts have a common file \texttt{default.php}, which handles the default settings. It is placed at ./, which is the \texttt{PDR\_FILE\_SYSTEM\_APPLICATION\_PATH}.
See the file below:
\lstinputlisting[language=PHP]{../default.php}

\subsection{Directory structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{config/} Contains the configuration file config.php
\item \texttt{css/} \emph{obsolete}, use \texttt{src/css/} instead
\item \texttt{docs/} This documentation and tools to build it
\item \texttt{img/} Images used by the program
\item \texttt{js/}  \emph{obsolete}, use \texttt{src/js/} instead
\item \texttt{locale/} translation files for gettext, currently only german (de\_DE)
\item \texttt{src/} Most of the actual source code
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{src/css} Style Sheets
    \item \texttt{src/js} JavasScript
    \item \texttt{src/php/} PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
    \item \texttt{src/php/classes/} Contains all the class files class.class\_name.php
    \item \texttt{src/php/fragments/} parts of bigger pages, may be included via php require/include or loaded with JavaScript
    \item \texttt{\textbf{src/php/pages/}} This is the place for the single views, which the human user will use to look at the roster etc.
    \item \texttt{src/sql/} SQL Database Tables and Triggers
    \end{itemize}
\item \texttt{tests/} Tests to find errors in the source code; This folder is listed in .gitignore. Only some files are part of the visible source.
\item \texttt{tmp/} A directy for temporary files. There is no automatic cleanup yet.
